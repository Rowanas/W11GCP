# Week 11-12 Group Cinema Project

This is our Week 11 and 12 Group Cinema Project


## Getting Started

The software we used for coding was [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). 

Our [Jira board is here](https://rowanatwork.atlassian.net/jira/software/projects/W11GCP/boards/3).

Some of our initial designs were made using [Design IO](https://www.design-io.com/). 

I'm not sure how we'll run it when it's built, so leaving this with placeholder.

### Prerequisites

VS code is a good start. need to talk to the lads about this bit.

### Building

Again, building, not sure.

## Running the tests

To run our test, simply open a console in our project folder and run npm test. This will also kick off istanbul, for coverage purposes.

### Unit and Integration Tests 

We'll see what we end up testing.

## Acknowledgments

* As will likely be the case for any of my work going forward, a huge tip of the hat to the stackExchange community, whose years of questions provided many useful fixes.
* To Jordan, without whom we would have stumbled after so little training.
* To the companionship and good humour of the rest of the 22AprEnable2 cohort, without which we would not have been able to push on to the project's end.

<!-- Notes and difficulties for putting in presentation
Difficult to keep exactly to spec, as the spec asks for many things that are totally unreasonable and anti-UX in reality
Lack of experience led to points being assigned incorrectly to team members, resulting in wildly unbalanced workloads -->
